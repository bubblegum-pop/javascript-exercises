Determine if arguments are positive integers
If they are, determine which argument is smallest
Start with the smallest argument, and increment by 1 until reaching the largest
Add each incremented value to result
Return result
If at least one argument is not a positive integer, result = "ERROR"

To check for positive integer:
- Is it a number?
- Is it a positive number?
- Is it an integer? 2 % 1 = 0
